Code for producing figures for cosyne poster 2023

## Part 1: Characterisation of depth tunings for neurons in V1
### Example neurons
- TO FIND CODE: raster plot of one depth-tuned neurons
- TO FIND CODE: average PSTH of 5 neurons
- TO FIND CODE: depth turning of the 5 neurons
- TO FIND CODE: RF

### Summary
- DONE: raster plot of average PSTH of all neurons, ordered by preferred depths (gaussian fitted)
- TO FIND CODE: spatial distribution of depth neurons for one session (or several sessions and put them together?)
- TO FIND CODE: distribution of depth preference (gaussian fitted)


## Part 2: Depth selectivity of V1 neurons arises from integration of running & optic flow signals
### Example neurons
- CODE DONE, WHICH ONES TO USE?: depth tuning + trace against OF/RS plot + heatmap (closeloop)
- CODE DONE, WHICH ONES TO USE?: depth tuning + trace against OF/RS plot + extended heatmap (openloop)

### Summary
- DONE: closeloop vs openloop preferred depth, RS, OF; open loop RS/OF vs closeloop preferred depth
